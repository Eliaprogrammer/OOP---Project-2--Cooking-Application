# OOP---Project-2--Cooking-Application
Elia Schwartz, COP 3330C - 33777, May 13, 2025.

Programming project objective: This Project aims to teach students how to implement and use inheritance and polymorphism. 
I create a Cooking interface with four abstract methods: prepareDish, cooking, serveDish, and completeDish that can be used in the FoodDish (parent) class and two subclasses: Burger and Pasta. HomeCooking allows the program to run and create objects.

The majority of the inputs are from the objects created, returning the specific output associated with the information
in the object parameter to the console when a method in the class is called.

Lines 57, 59, 61, 88,90, 92 directly ask the user for input from the console, then adjust each method to print
output according to the information in the console.
