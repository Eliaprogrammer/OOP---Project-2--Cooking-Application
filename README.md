Programming project objective: This Project aims to teach students how to implement and use
inheritance and polymorphism. 

The majority of the inputs are from the objects created, returning the specific output associated with the information
in the object parameter to the console when a method in the class is called.

Lines 57, 59, 61, 88,90, 92 directly ask the user for input from the console, then adjust each method to print
output according to the information in the console.
